# The Samples Project

The **Samples Project** is a repository containing source code, deployment descriptors,
and configurations for various other projects. These are not productive projects, but

* articles,
* talks,
* trainings and
* workshops.

These then refer to the **Sample Project** examples. It is loosely coupled in itself and yet
tries to create a coordinated world. In this way the different users, i.e. the articles
and co., can benefit from each other.

I hope you enjoy it.
