# Samples

The samples repository is a little helper for other projects. Those are different

* talks,
* workshops,
* trainings, and
* articles.

All those are around programming languages - mostly Go - and deployment desriptors.
I try to create one logical world here, as a single solution. But with modules matching
to the different topic. Also everything will be documented to understand the ideas
and how it works. May even look too documented for a productive code later. :smile:

The different talks, workshops, trainings, and articles then will ohne reference the
accrding parts of the code here.
